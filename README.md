CryptoDesk AI is an AI-powered desktop trading co-pilot built with a security-first architecture. The current alpha is designed around three principles:

- non-custodial credential handling
- simulation-first learning and testing
- explainable, advisory-only AI

This repository is ready for controlled beta review, contributor onboarding, and release operations. Live trading remains intentionally gated until signing, runtime hardening, and broader validation are complete.

## Current Alpha Scope

What ships today:

- real-time market data through validated Electron IPC flows.
- read-only portfolio preview
- simulation trading with isolated virtual balances
- explainable AI signals with transparent filtering and metrics
- bilingual user experience in English and Arabic
- onboarding flow with explicit risk acknowledgment

What is intentionally limited in `v1.0.0-alpha.1`:

- Windows build only
- unsigned alpha build
- simulation-first usage path
- AI is advisory only and never auto-executes trades
- public live-trading execution is still disabled

## Quick Start

1. Download the latest Windows alpha from [Releases](https://github.com/FreeDropOracle/CryptoDesk-ai/releases).
2. Extract the zip archive to a new folder.
3. Run `CryptoDesk AI.exe`.
4. Complete onboarding.
5. Start in Simulation Mode before testing any exchange connectivity.

## Downloads

| Platform | Version | Link |
|----------|---------|------|
| Windows x64 | 1.0.0-alpha.1 | [Download ZIP](https://github.com/FreeDropOracle/CryptoDesk-ai/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha.1) |

Alpha notes:

- Windows may show an `Unknown Publisher` warning because code signing is not enabled yet.
- The primary tester artifact is a zip package, not an installer.
- The recommended path for new testers is onboarding plus simulation mode.

## Security First

- renderer code has no direct Node.js or credential access
- preload is the only privileged bridge into the main process
- IPC payloads are validated with Zod before privileged work runs
- secrets are stored locally with OS keychain integration and AES-256-GCM encryption
- the product is non-custodial by design

See [Security Protocol](docs/security/encryption-spec.md) and [Threat Model](docs/architecture/threat-model.md).
